# Simple Docs AI

## Inspiration:
As a first-generation college student from an immigrant family, I grew up helping my parents understand complex documents like medical and academic forms. I experienced firsthand the comprehension barrier non-native English speakers and others face daily. This led me to create Simple Docs AI, a powerful tool designed to demystify complicated paperwork and streamline the form-filling process for everyone.

## What It Does:
Simple Docs AI empowers users to understand complex academic, medical, and other forms/texts. The user can upload a file or paste text, and the AI assistant, leveraging RAG, generates concise translated summaries that are easy to understand based on their chosen language. From here, the user can have the option of listening to the simplified content narrated back to them or read through it themselves. In addition, the user has access to a voice agent that assists them in the form-filling process and answers any questions regarding the selected document. At the end, a copy of the filled document and chat log is automatically sent to the user's email inbox.
