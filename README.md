# SimpleDocsAI

## Inspiration:
As a first-generation college student from an immigrant family, I grew up helping my parents understand complex documents like medical and academic forms. I experienced firsthand the comprehension barrier non-native English speakers and others face daily. This led me to create SimpleDocsAI, a powerful tool designed to demystify complicated paperwork and streamline the form-filling process for everyone.

## What It Does:
SimpleDocsAI empowers users to understand complex academic, medical, and other forms/texts. The user can upload a file or paste text, and the AI assistant, leveraging RAG, generates concise translated summaries that are easy to understand based on their chosen language. From here, the user can have the option of listening to the simplified content narrated back to them or interact with the voice agent to ask questions about the document's content to gain additional clarification.
